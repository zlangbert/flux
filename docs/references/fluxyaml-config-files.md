# Manifest generation through `.flux.yaml` configuration files

This feature lets you generate Kubernetes manifests with a program,
instead of having to include them in your git repo as YAML files. For
example, you can use `kustomize` to patch a common set of resources to
suit a particular environment.

Manifest generation is controlled by the flags given to `fluxd`, and
`.flux.yaml` files in your git repo.

To enable it, you will need to

 1. pass the command-line flag `--manifest-generation=true`
to `fluxd`.
 2. put at least one `.flux.yaml` file in the git repository.

Where to put `.flux.yaml`, and what should be in it, are described in
the sections following.

## Setting manifest generation up

The command-line flag `--git-path` (which can be given multiple
values) marks a "target path" within the git repository in which to
find manifests. If `--git-path` is not supplied, the top of the git
repository is assumed to be the sole target path.

Without manifest generation, fluxd will recursively walk the
directories under each target path, to look for YAML files.

With manifest generation **enabled**, fluxd will look for processing
instructions in a file `.flux.yaml`, which can be located _at_ the
target path, or in a directory _above_ it in the git repository.

 - if a `.flux.yaml` file is found, it is used **instead** of looking
   for YAML files, and no other files are examined for that target
   path;

 - if no `.flux.yaml` file is found, the usual behaviour of looking
   for YAML files is adopted for that target path.

 - a `.flux.yaml` file containing the `scanForFiles` directive resets
   the behaviour to looking for YAML files. This is explained below.

The manifests from all the target paths -- read from YAML files or
generated -- are combined before applying to the cluster. If
duplicates are detected, an error is logged and fluxd will abandon the
attempt to apply manifests to the cluster.

Here are some examples:

```
.
├── base
│   ├── demo-ns.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   ├── podinfo-dep.yaml
│   ├── podinfo-hpa.yaml
│   └── podinfo-svc.yaml
├── .flux.yaml
├── production
│   ├── flux-patch.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   └── replicas-patch.yaml
└── staging
    ├── flux-patch.yaml
    └── kustomization.yaml
```

In this case, say you started `fluxd` with `--git-path=staging`, it
would find `.flux.yaml` in the top directory and use that to generate
manifests.  The other files and directories (if there were any) in
`staging/` are not examined by fluxd, in favour of following the
instructions given in the `.flux.yaml` file.

This layout could also be used with `--git-path=production`.

In this modified example, the `.flux.yaml` file has been moved under
`staging/`:

```
.
├── base
│   ├── demo-ns.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   ├── podinfo-dep.yaml
│   ├── podinfo-hpa.yaml
│   └── podinfo-svc.yaml
├── production
│   ├── flux-patch.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   └── replicas-patch.yaml
└── staging
    ├── flux-patch.yaml
    ├── .flux.yaml
    └── kustomization.yaml
```

… since the `.flux.yaml` file is now under `staging/`, it will still
take effect for `--git-path=staging`. However:

Using `--git-path=production` would **not produce a usable
configuration**, because without an applicable `.flux.yaml`, the files
under `production/` would be treated as plain Kubernetes manifests,
which they are plainly not.

Note also that the configuration file would **not** take effect for
`--git-path=.` (i.e., the top directory), because manifest generation
will not look in subdirectories for a `.flux.yaml` file.

### The `scanForFiles` directive

The `scanForFiles` directive indicates that the target path should be
treated as though it had _no_ `.flux.yaml` in effect. In other words,
fluxd will look for YAML files under the directory, and update
manifests directly by rewriting the YAML files.

Here's an example `.flux.yaml` with the `scanForFiles` directive:

```
version: 1
scanForFiles: {}
```

(The `{}` is an empty map, which acts as a placeholder value).

This is to account for the case in which you have a `.flux.yaml`
higher in the directory tree, applying to several target paths beneath
it, but want to have a directory wth regular YAMLs as well.

In the following example, the top-level `.flux.yaml` would take effect
for `--git-path=staging` or `--git-path=production`.

But if you wanted `yamls/permissions.yaml` to be applied (as it is),
you could put a `.flux.yaml` containing `scanForFiles` in that directory, and
specify `--git-path=staging,yamls`.

```

├── .flux.yaml
├── base
│   ├── demo-ns.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   ├── podinfo-dep.yaml
│   ├── podinfo-hpa.yaml
│   └── podinfo-svc.yaml
├── production
│   ├── flux-patch.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   └── replicas-patch.yaml
├── yamls
│   ├── .flux.yaml # (with "scanForFiles" directive)
│   └── permissions.yaml
└── staging
    ├── flux-patch.yaml
    └── kustomization.yaml
```

## How to construct a .flux.yaml file

Aside from the special case of the `scanForFiles` directive,
`.flux.yaml` files come in two varieties: "patch-updated",
"command-updated". These refer to the way in which [automated
updates](./automated-image-update.md) are applied to files in the
repo:

 - when patch-updated, fluxd will keep updates in its own patch file,
   which it applies to the generated manifests before applying to the
   cluster;
 - when command-updated, you must supply commands to update the
   appropriate file or files.

Patch-updated will work with any kind of manifest generation, because
the patch is entirely managed by `fluxd` and applied post-hoc to the
manifests.

Command-updated is more general, but since you need to supply your own
programs to find and update the right file, it is likely to be a lot
more work.

Both patch-updated and command-updated configurations have the same
way of specifying how to generate manifests, and differ only in how
updates are recorded.

### Generator configuration

Here is an example of a `.flux.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1 # must be `1`
patchUpdated:
  generators:
  - command: kustomize build .
  patchFile: flux-patch.yaml
```

The `generators` field is an array of commands, all of which will be
run in turn. Each command is expected to print a YAML stream to its
stdout. The streams are concatenated and parsed as one big YAML
stream, before being applied.

Much of the time, it will only be necessary to supply one command to
be run.

The commands will be run with the target path being processed as a
working directory -- which is not necessarily the same directory in
which the `.flux.yaml` file was found. [See below](#execution-context)
for more details on the execution context in which commands are run.

### Using patch-updated configuration

A patch-updated configuration generates manifests using commands, and
records updates as a set of [strategic merge][strategic-merge] patches
in a file.

For example, when an automated image upgrade is run, fluxd will do
this:

 1. run the generator commands and parse the manifests;
 2. find the manifest that needs to be updated, and calculate the
    patch to it that performs the update;
 3. record that patch in the patch file.

When syncing, fluxd will generate the manifests as usual, then apply
all the patches that have been recorded in the patch file.

This is how a patch-updated `.flux.yaml` looks in general:

```yaml
version: 1
patchUpdated:
  generators:
  - command: generator_command
  patchFile: path/to/patch.yaml
```

The `generators` field is explained just above. The `patchFile` field
gives a path, relative to the target path, in which to record
patches. `fluxd` will create or update the file when needed, and
commit any changes it makes to git.

> Note: at present, it is necessary to manually remove patches that
> refer to deleted manifests. See [issue #2428][#2428]

### Using command-updated configuration

A command-updated configuration generates manifests in the same way,
but records changes by running commands as given in the `.flux.yaml`.

This is how a command-updated `.flux.yaml` looks in general:

```yaml
version: 1
commandUpdated:
  generators:
  - command: generator_command
  updaters:
  - containerImage:
      command: image_updater_program
    policy:
      command: policy_updater_program
```

The `updaters` section is particular to command-updated
configuration. It contains an array of updaters, each of which gives a
command for updating container images, and a command for updating
policies (policy controls how automated updates should be applied to a
resource; these appear as annotations in generated manifests).

When asked to update a resource, fluxd will run execute the
appropriate variety of command for *each* entry in `updaters:`. For
example, when updating an image, it will execute the command under
`containerImage`, for each updater entry, in turn.

Usually updates come in batches -- e.g., updating the same container
image in several resources -- so the commands will likely be run
several times.

### Execution context of commands

`generators` and `updaters` are run in a POSIX shell inside the fluxd
container. This means that the executables mentioned in commands must
be available in the running fluxd container.

Flux currently includes `kustomize`, `sops` and basic Unix shell tools.
If the tools in the Flux image are not sufficient for your use case,
you have some options:

 - build your own custom image based on the [Flux
   image][flux-dockerfile] that includes the tooling you need, and run
   that image instead of `fluxcd.io/flux`;
 - copy files from an `initContainer` into a volume shared by the flux
   container, within the deployment.

In the future it may be possible to specify an container image for
each command, rather than relying on the tooling being in the
filesystem.

The working directory (also known as CWD) of the `command`s executed
from a `.flux.yaml` file will be set to the target path, i.e., the
`--git-path` entry.

For example, when using flux with `--git-path=staging` on a git
repository with this structure:

```sh
├── .flux.yaml
├── staging/
├──── [...]
├── production/
└──── [...]
```

… the commands in `.flux.yaml` will be executed with their working
directory set to `staging`.

In addition, commands from `updaters` are given arguments via
environment variables, when executed:

 * `FLUX_WORKLOAD`: the workload to be updated. Its format is
  `<namespace>:<kind>/<name>` (e.g. `default:deployment/foo`). For
  convenience (to circumvent parsing) `FLUX_WORKLOAD` is also broken
  down into the following environment variables:
  * `FLUX_WL_NS`
  * `FLUX_WL_KIND`
  * `FLUX_WL_NAME`

 * `containerImage` updaters are provided with:
   * `FLUX_CONTAINER`: Name of the container within the workload whose image needs to be updated.
   * `FLUX_IMG`: Image name which the container needs to be updated to (e.g. `nginx`).
   * `FLUX_TAG`: Image tag which the container needs to be updated to (e.g. `1.15`).

 * `policy` updaters are provided with:
   * `FLUX_POLICY`: the name of the policy to be added or updated in
     the workload. To make into an annotation name, prefix with
     `fluxcd.io/`
   * `FLUX_POLICY_VALUE`: value of the policy to be added or updated
     in the controller. If the `FLUX_POLICY_VALUE` environment
     variable is not set, it means the policy should be removed.

Please note that the default timeout for sync commands is set to one
minute. If you run into errors like `error executing generator
command: context deadline exceeded`, you can increase the timeout with
the `--sync-timeout` fluxd command flag or the `sync.timeout` Helm
chart option.
